# Exam Score Prediction using Linear Regression

This project predicts student exam scores using a Linear Regression machine learning model.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a regression model that can predict exam scores based on input features.  
The model is trained, evaluated, and saved for reuse.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- Algorithm: Linear Regression
- Type: Supervised Learning (Regression)

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Files
- `Linear_regression.ipynb` – Model training, evaluation, and visualization
- `Exam_score_predictor.pkl` – Saved trained model

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook
3. Run all cells to train the model
4. Use the saved `.pkl` file to make predictions
